# ottonova

**HOW TO START THE PROJECT**
1. git clone https://github.com/MOHITRAJANI/ottonova.git
2. cd ottonova
3. In a terminal run: npm install
4. Then run: **npm run initialize** (This will take a couple of minutes but will install all dependencies of the project in the respective folders.)
5. Finally run: **npm start** (This will concurrently start the backend on PORT 3000 and Frontend on PORT 8080)
6. In order to run the tests; first run step 5 so that the server is running to send data through REST, after the server is running, **npm run test**
7. Finally, in order to check the test coverage powerd by V8, again do Step 5 and when the server is running, run: **npm run coverage**

**ottonova JavaScript Coding Challenge**

The Task:

**The gist**: Implement a backend to return JSON data and a frontend to display it.
1. Try to solve the task as you would in your day to day work.
2. Document the project so that another developer could start working on it.
3. Feel free to use whatever toolchain you are most comfortable with.
4. Use JavaScript or TypeScript for the backend and the frontend.
5. Do your best in terms of UI and UX design.
6. Please push your finished code to a public git repository of your choosing (e.g.
GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab, etc.).

**The backend**
 -> The backend should be able to return JSON data via a REST API endpoint.

**The frontend**
 -> The frontend should retrieve the data from the backend and display it.

**The data**
 -> The JSON data is a set of cities with a lot of different information.

Feel free to use the data in creative ways.
You can find the data in the enclosed JSON file.
**Be as creative as you want.**
