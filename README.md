ottonova JavaScript Coding Challenge


**The gist**: Implement a backend to return JSON data and a frontend to display it.
1. Try to solve the task as you would in your day to day work.
2. Document the project so that another developer could start working on it.
3. Feel free to use whatever toolchain you are most comfortable with.
4. Use JavaScript or TypeScript for the backend and the frontend.
5. Do your best in terms of UI and UX design.
6. Please push your finished code to a public git repository of your choosing (e.g.
GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab, etc.).

**The backend**
 -> The backend should be able to return JSON data via a REST API endpoint.

**The frontend**
 -> The frontend should retrieve the data from the backend and display it.

**The data**
 -> The JSON data is a set of cities with a lot of different information.

Feel free to use the data in creative ways.
You can find the data in the enclosed JSON file.
**Be as creative as you want.**
